Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithms
Introduction:
Fake news has become a significant issue in today's digital age, leading to misinformation and manipulation of public opinion. This project aims to address the problem of fake news by developing machine learning algorithms capable of detecting and classifying fake news articles.

Project Overview:
The project utilizes various machine learning techniques to analyze textual data and identify patterns indicative of fake news. By training models on labeled datasets containing both real and fake news articles, we aim to create a reliable system for automatically detecting fake news.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project consists of a collection of news articles labeled as either real or fake. These articles cover a wide range of topics and come from diverse sources. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.

Machine Learning Algorithms:
Several machine learning algorithms are employed in this project for fake news detection, including but not limited to:

Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
